          way Evius operates, and to regulatory and technological requirements. We will provide a notice about the
          updated policy within reasonable time in advance to allow you to review the changes and decide whether you
          wish to continue using the Service. Our notices will be posted, as applicable, on the Site, and we will also

          includes a credit card number and related account and billing information, invoice-related information, and
          other data required to process the order. We will use the tools and services of third-party service providers

          others. The notices and tools that we provide on the Services should help inform you which information will be

          will share statistical and analytical information with our third-party service providers and partners such as
          our data hosting providers (&quot;Third-Party Services&quot;) to improve our Services. We also use standard
          analytics tools of Google Analytics and we will use additional or other analytics tools, from time to time.
          The privacy practices of these tools are subject to their own privacy policies. The Google Analytics Privacy

          violations thereof; (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud or security issues; or (iv) protect
          against harm to the rights, property, or safety of Evius, our users, yourself or the public. 5.8. We will use
          your Personal Information to provide you with features of the Service related to content and interactions and
          details about other events, in addition to the event that you have registered to. Choice and Opting Out You
          may choose not to receive future promotional, advertising or other Services-related emails from us by
          selecting an unsubscribe link at the bottom of each email that we send. Please note that even if you opt out

          section in this policy. To assist you with your request to access and rectify your personal information, we
          will need to ask you to provide us certain credentials to make sure that you are who you claim to be. We may
          decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical
          effort, jeopardize the privacy of others or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning
          information residing on backup tapes). We may redact from the data which we will make available to you, any
          personal information related to others. Links to and Interaction with Third Party Products. The Services
          enable you to interact with or contain links to your Third Party Account and other third party websites and
          Third Party Services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these sites or Third

          that you choose to use or interact with. Children’s Privacy. The Services are not structured to attract and
          are not intended for use by children under the age of 13 years. Accordingly, we do not intend to collect
          Personal Information from anyone we know to be under 13 years. If we learn that we have collected Personal
          Information from a child under 13 years, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you
          believe that we might have any such information, please contact us at support@Evius.co. Security. The security
          of Personal Information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards, including the use
          of appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards, to protect the Personal Information
          submitted to us. These measures and controls are governed by the ISO 27001 information security international
          standard. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100%
          secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information,
          we cannot guarantee its absolute security or confidentiality. If you have any questions about security on the
          Service, you can contact us at support@Evius.co. Merger, Sale or Bankruptcy. In the event that we are acquired
          by or merged with a third party entity, or in the event of bankruptcy or a comparable event, we will transfer

          provide us with analytics tools, to collect personally identifiable information about an individual consumer’s
          online activities over time and across different websites when a consumer uses the Services. Transfer Data

          as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements for 90 days
          after we complete our engagement with the organizer. In addition, after you delete your identifiable
          information, residual copies will remain in our backup systems for a certain period of time before they are
          deleted from our active servers. This deletion of your data will not change or delete identifiable information
          which may have already been shared with third parties, as permitted in this Privacy Policy or any other
          agreement between you and us. Other information that we do not need to maintain, will be removed following the
          termination of the agreement with the relevant Event Organizer. We will keep aggregated non-identifiable
          information without limitation, and to the extent reasonable we will delete or de-identify potentially
          identifiable information, when we no longer need to process the information. Commitment. We are committed to
          protecting your privacy. Protecting your privacy online is an evolving area, and we are constantly evolving
          our Service to meet these demands. If you have any comments, concerns about the way we process your personal
          information or questions regarding our Privacy Policy, please contact us at support@Evius.co.
